### Firefox Doesn't Support Bluetooth
- This was a work in progress GoRPG Extension for Firefox but due to lack of Bluetooth support in firefox the extension cannot function as intended. 
- The extension is currently **non-functional** due to the Bluetooth connection dialog not being displayed. See: https://github.com/FroggMaster/GoRPG-Firefox/issues/1
