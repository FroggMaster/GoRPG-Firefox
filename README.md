# GoRPG-Firefox
- This is a work in progress GoRPG Extension for Firefox
- I've taken the GoRPG Chrome Extension source code from the CRX file and I'm working on converting the extension to a Firefox Compatible XPI. 
- The extension is currently non-functional due to the Bluetooth connection dialog not being displayed. See: https://github.com/FroggMaster/GoRPG-Firefox/issues/1
- Pull Requests are welcomed and encouraged!
