# GoRPG-Firefox
- GoRPG Extension for Firefox
- This is the GoRPG Extension that was originally developed for Chrome. I've pulled the source code and am working on converting the extension to a Firefox Compatible format. 
- Pull Requests are welcomed and encouraged!
- This is a WIP and current is non-functional due to incompatibilies with the Data Cloning algorith used by the extension; See: https://github.com/FroggMaster/GoRPG-Firefox/issues/1
